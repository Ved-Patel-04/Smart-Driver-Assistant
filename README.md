# Smart Driver Assistant 

An AI-powered driving assistant system that enhances road safety by detecting:
- **Driver Drowsiness** using facial landmarks
- **Traffic Signs** using YOLOv8 object detection
- **Lane Departures** using edge and line detection

Built with Python, OpenCV, and deep learning, this project is optimized for edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.

## Features
- Real-time webcam processing
- Alerts for drowsiness and unsafe driving conditions
- Scalable and modular codebase
- Custom-trained traffic sign recognition model (optional)

## Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional)
- Flask (for dashboard â€“ optional)

## Coming Soon
- Cloud dashboard or onboard display
- Speed limit compliance tracking
- Integration with mobile notifications
